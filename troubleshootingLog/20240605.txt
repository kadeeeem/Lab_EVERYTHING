Had to recreate my Ansible lab after breaking the sudo command on my RaspberryPi.
Starting from scratch with 3 Routers in CML.

Goal for today:
Make routers pingable from LAN.
Create inventory file for host devices.
Confirm new Debian VM can SSH into each router.
Test reachability to devices using Ansible. Record result.

#--- Router info:

R1: 10.0.0.101
R2: 10.0.0.102
R3: 10.0.0.103

#--- Reachability results:

Pinging 10.0.0.101 with 32 bytes of data:

#--- Inventory File

[MyRouters]
10.0.0.101
10.0.0.102
10.0.0.103

This is the documentation being used as a reference btw:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html

Confirmed inventory file:

ansible-inventory -i hosts.ini --list

Output:
{
    "MyRouters": {
        "hosts": [
            "10.0.0.101",
            "10.0.0.102",
            "10.0.0.103"
        ]
    },
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {}
    },
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "ungrouped",
            "MyRouters"
        ]
    }
}

#--- Testing

Ran an Ad-hoc command to test reachability.

ansible MyRouters -m ping -i hosts.ini

Fill in the blanks with your own information:
ansible <hostGroup> -m <module> -i <inventoryFile>

In this scenario, the module being used is "ping". 
--> Documentation for all Ansible modules:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html

Output of the above command:

10.0.0.101 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 10.0.0.101 port 22: Connection refused",
    "unreachable": true
}
10.0.0.102 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 10.0.0.102 port 22: Connection refused",
    "unreachable": true
}
10.0.0.103 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 10.0.0.103 port 22: Connection refused",
    "unreachable": true
}

Need to enable SSH on routers

#--- Procedure:
NOTE: Create a document on this

R1:
ip domain-name LAB
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
ip ssh ver 2
username kadeem password cisco
!
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh

Result of next test:
Unable to negotiate with 10.0.0.101 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

Information says to add the key exchange methods mentioned above to a .ssh file.
Was not visible using ls -a
Ran a search:
 find / -type f -name .ssh*
No result

Search results say the file/folder is created automatically after generating SSH keys. See source below.

Found ssh config file at /etc/ssh/ssh_config
ssh_config man page

KexAlgorithms
             Specifies the available KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms.  Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.  If the specified list begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified algo‐
             rithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘-’ character, then the specified algorithms (including wildcards)
             will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.  If the specified list begins with a ‘^’ character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at the head of
             the default set.  The default is:

                   sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com,
                   curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,
                   ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,
                   diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,
                   diffie-hellman-group18-sha512,
                   diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

             The list of available key exchange algorithms may also be obtained using "ssh -Q kex".

Created config file at /~/.ssh/config:
Host 10.0.0.101
   KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

New error:
Unable to negotiate with 10.0.0.101 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa

To that same config file I added:
HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa

Final result after testing:
The authenticity of host '10.0.0.101 (10.0.0.101)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Uzukt37YD/oX6YdiLPz4oQ7sh/LNfknopWbc6bAialA.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Was prompted to enter a password. The credentials I created initially did not work. Had to add "login local" to the vty lines.

New error when running Ansible ping module:
10.0.0.101 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: \r\n**************************************************************************\r\n* IOSv is strictly limited to use for evaluation, demonstration and IOS  *\r\n* education.
